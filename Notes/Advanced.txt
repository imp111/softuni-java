1. Stacks and Queues

	Algorith:
	
		Algorithm Complexity - describes performance of particular algorithm
		Runtime and memory consumption is based on input size N.
	
	Stacks:
		
		Create stack:
		- ArrayDeque<dataType> nameOfTheStack = new ArrayDeque<dataType>(size);
	
		Add element to the stack:
		- stack.push(element);
		
		Remove element from the stack (the last element that was added to the stack):
		- stack.pop();
		
		Get the last element of the stack:
		- Integer element = stack.peek();
		
		Stack Utility Methods:
			- int sizeOfStack = stack.size();
			- boolean isEmpty = stack.isEmpty();
			- boolean exists = stack.contains(element);
