1. Stacks and Queues

	Algorithm:
		Algorithm Complexity - describes the performance of the particular algorithm.
		Runtime and memory consumption is based on input size N.
	
	Stacks:
		- ArrayDeque<dataType> nameOfTheStack = new ArrayDeque<dataType>(size); // Create stack:
		- stack.push(element); // Add element to the stack:
		- stack.pop(); // Remove element from the stack (the last element that was added to the stack):
		- Integer element = stack.peek(); // Get the last element of the stack:
		
		Stack Utility Methods:
			- int sizeOfStack = stack.size();
			- boolean isEmpty = stack.isEmpty();
			- boolean exists = stack.contains(element);
