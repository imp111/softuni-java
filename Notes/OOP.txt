1. Encapsulation

	- What is Encapsulation (keyword this, private fields, properties, constructors)
	- Access Modifiers
	- Validation
	- Mutuable and Immutable Objects (getters and setters)
	- Keyword final

	Encapsulation means hiding implementation
		- wraps the code and data together into a single unit
		- flexibility and extensibility of the code
		- reduces complexity
		- allows validation and data binding
		- structural changes remain local


	The different fields of the class must be private. We use getters (accessor) and setters (mutator) for data access.
	Getters and Setters are public.

	Keyword this: "This" is reference to the current object (the current instance of a class). This can also invoke current class methods or constructors.

	Access Modifiers:
		- private - can be accessed only within the declared class itself (interfaces and classes cannot be private)
		- protected - acess to inherited classes, and in the same package. Grants access to subclasses (cannot be applied to interfaces and classes). It prevents nonrelated classes from using it
		- public - grants access to any class in the Java Universe (accessible by anyone)
		- default (when we don't declare any access modifier) - available to any other class in the same package

	
	Validation:
	
		Validation happens in:
			- setters (mutators)
			- constructor

		When doing validation, it is better to throw exceptions, rather than printing out on the console.

		When validating inside the constructor, it is best to use private setters inside the constructor:
			
			- guarantees valid state of object in its creation
			- guarantees valid state for public setters

			private String name;			// this is the private field
			private void setName(String name) {	// this is the private setter, that also validates the data

				if (name == "Gosho") {
					throw new IllegalArgumentExpection("Not available name");	// throws exception if true
				}
				else {
					this.name = name;						// else sets the field to the given value
				}
			}

			public Person(String name) {							// sets the field to the already validated value
				setName(name);
			}

			
	Mutable and Immutable Objects (Collections.unmodifiable()):
	
		Mutable (the contents of the instance can be altered/changed)
		Immutable (the contents of the instance cannot be altered/changed)

		Example where private fields are not fully encapsulated:
			class Team {
				private List<Person> players;

				public Team() {
					this.players = new ArrayList<>();
				}

				public List<Person> getPlayers() {
					return this.players;
				}

			}

			Team team = new Team();
			Person p1 = new Person("Gosho", "Goshev", 15);
			team.getPlayers().add(p1); // this should not be happening, encapsulation is broken


			In this case, when we use the getter, we can access the other List<> functionalities, such as (add, remove, etc.).
			That's why we use the Collections.unmodifiable(), which still lets us use this functionalities, but it doesn't have direct implementation, and throws an exception.
			
			class Team {
				private List<Person> players;
				
				public void addPlayer(Person person) {
					this.players.add(person);
				}
					
				public List<Person> getPlayers() {
					return Collections.unmodifiableList(players); // using that, will not let the list to be changed, we can only add to the list
				}
			}

	
	Keyword final:

		final class - cannot be extended (inherited)
		final method - cannot be overriden (changed)
		final fields and variables - cannot be changed once they are set ('=' no longer works, can't assign new value to it)
